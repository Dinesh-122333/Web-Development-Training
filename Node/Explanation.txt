Node:
	It is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code
Working :
	Non blocking or Asynchronus Nature

	ex:
	     if a waiter comes two your table and gives to kitchen then they use to serve to another table while the dish is readying by the kitchen

	--> A single thread handles multiple request
	--> Node is  ideal for I/O -intensive app
	--> Not for Cpu intensive apps like video encoding and image manipulation

Global Function:

	--> console.log();
	--> setTimeout();
	--> clearTimeout();
	--> setInterval()
	--> clearInterval();

	--> where window is used for global object but in node global keyword is used
eg:
	global.setInterval()

Module:
	we need to create small building blocks or Module where we defines our variables and functions two variables or two functions 
	with same name don't overwrite another variables or functions defined somewhere else that encapsulation inside 

Creating a Module:

	example in Module1.js

Loading the Module:
	example in app2.js
	
	using require functions
		it takes one argument and that the name or path of the target module we want 
		to load

	--> using const for declaring logger variables is manditory

using of jshint :
	It is used to find any error in the particular file or Not

	ex:
		jshint app.js in cmd


Module wrapper functions:
	(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname){ block contains }) 
	Wrapper functions

Built-in module:
	--> using path module gives the info about the file 
	--> using os module it gives the info about my local machine or serve info where I 
	Working
	--> using file module gives the all file name present in current directory and some info
	--> using event module like  event handling only
		*event argument
			emitter.on ('logging', (arg) => {
				console.log('Listener logged', arg);
			});
			emitter.emit('logging', {id : 1, data : 'your here'});
		*extending EventEmitter
		 	calling one file to another
			ex: 
				in logger2.js to app7.js
	--> using http module
		*http server inherits from net.Server class, where the net.Server is a EventEmitter 
		so that all properties of EventEmitter had by the http server to  
always use Asynchronus method
