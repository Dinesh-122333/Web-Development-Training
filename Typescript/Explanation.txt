TypeScript:
    -->its is a programming lang created by Microsoft to address shortcomings of JS
    ex:
    brother or sister of JS, where a discipline one
    --> TypeScript build top of the JavaScript
    --> Static type language
    ex :
        int num = 10; where num is integer where 
    --> JavaScript with TypeChecking
    --> Where i run the typescript code i got a JavaScript file which change to JavaScript code on it. 
Drawbacks:
    --> Compilation (where it not runs directly in browser where as it runs in compiler to change into JS and
    this process is called tranpilation)
    --> Discipline in codding
