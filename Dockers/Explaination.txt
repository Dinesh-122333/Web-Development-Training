Before Dockers:
        --> One application runs on the server
        --> For new or more application so they need to buy the required server
        --> Then Virtual Machine runs in same server finded by VMware
        --> If a application is shared there would might be a version problem like, 
        it can be a lower or higher version 

Container:
        --> Dockers made popular
        --> No need of entirely new OS to use it
        --> In reality Container runs top of Virtual Machine
        --> Linux Container are more popular
        --> Running instance of the image

Installation:
        Windows: Dockers Desktop + Windows SubSystem
        Mac: VM and Dockers Desktop
        Linux: As itself

        Documentation - https://docs.docker.com/

Dockers:
    --> Container Platform - to deploy, test and build application quicly
    --> Run time - allows us to start and stop Containers
        *runc (low level runtime)
        *containerd (manage the containers)
    --> Engine (Daemon)
        *communication b/w docker and ubuntu

Image:
        its just a file which contains all the instructions and everything

Docker file(list of instructions ) --> Image(class) -->  containers(object)

DevOps:

        *Dev - create your own application, docker file, img, containers
        *Ops - Download the image, runing the image, operating the image
